    Our ESG tool is based on 2 NLP models. The first model can read and classify articles by topic. It outputs 4 categories :
    * Environmental
    * Social
    * Governance
    * None
    The second model is based on Vader sentiment analysis and can assign a sentiment score to the article. On this stage all articles classified as "None" are ignored.
    We run a cumulative sum on the sentiments to plot a time series curve for each company.
